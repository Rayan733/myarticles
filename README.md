        <h1>Punitor Feminarum Nefanda</h1>
        <p>This website is dedicated to a woman.
            I would have never known the truth if she hadn't come into my life.
            Thank you for showing me how far some women can go for attention and control over a man.
            Every moment that I spent with her was a part of her mind games.
            And every move had a purpose.</p>

            <h2>1. The Gaslighter üß† </h2>
            <article>
                <h3>What Is Gaslighting?</h3>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/gaslighting?utm_source=chatgpt.com">
                    Gaslighting is a type of emotional abuse. Someone who is gaslighting will try to make a targeted
                    person doubt their perception of reality. The gaslighter may convince the target that their memories
                    are wrong or that they are overreacting to an event. The abuser may then present their own thoughts
                    and feelings as ‚Äúthe real truth.<br>
                    Gaslighting is an abusive tactic aimed to make a person doubt their own thoughts and feelings. The
                    abuse is often subtle at first. For example, if a person is telling a story, the abuser may
                    challenge a small detail. The person may admit they were wrong on a detail, then move on. The next
                    time, the abuser may use that past ‚Äúvictory‚Äù to discredit the person further, perhaps by questioning
                    the person‚Äôs memory.<br>
                    The person may argue back at first. They may intuit something is wrong in the relationship or
                    marriage. But because each gaslighting incident is so minor, they can‚Äôt pinpoint any specific cause
                    for their unease. Over time, the person may second-guess their own emotions and memories. They may
                    rely on their abuser to tell them if their memory is correct of if their emotions are ‚Äúreasonable.‚Äù
                    The abuser uses this trust to gain control over their target. <br>
                    Popular culture often depicts gaslighting as a man abusing his wife. Yet people of any gender can
                    gaslight others or be gaslit themselves. Gaslighting can also occur in platonic contexts such as a
                    workplace. Anyone can be a target.
                    A gaslighter often uses the target‚Äôs ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù and ‚Äúoverreactions‚Äù to cast themself as the victim.
                    For example, an abuser may scream accusations at a person until the other party must raise their
                    voice to be heard. The abuser may then cut the conversation short, claiming the other person is ‚Äúout
                    of control‚Äù and ‚Äútoo aggressive.‚Äù In some cases, the abuser may accuse the other person of being the
                    true gaslighter. <br>

                    <h3>How to Fight Gaslighting</h3>
                    Often the first step to protect yourself from gaslighting is to recognize its presence. Once you
                    know you are being manipulated, you can determine your own reality more easily.

                    Ideally, someone experiencing abuse would get help and possibly leave the relationship. Yet
                    sometimes barriers prevent a person from leaving right away. The person may be financially dependent
                    on their abuser, or there may be children involved. <br>

                    If you are a target of gaslighting, here are some tips you can use to defend yourself: <br>

                    <strong>Don‚Äôt take responsibility for the other person‚Äôs actions.</strong> The other person may
                    claim you provoked the abuse. If you avoid the actions that offended them in the past, the
                    gaslighter will likely come up with new excuses for their abuse. <br>
                    <strong>Don‚Äôt sacrifice yourself to spare their feelings.</strong> Even if you dedicate your whole
                    life to making them happy, you will never completely fill the other person‚Äôs desire for control.
                    People who gaslight others are often trying to fill a void in themselves. But they will not fix
                    their heart by breaking yours. <br>
                    <strong>Remember your truth.</strong> Just because the other person sounds sure of themself doesn‚Äôt
                    mean they are right. The gaslighter may never see your side of the story. Yet their opinion does not
                    define reality. Nor does it define who you are as a person. <br>
                    <strong>Do not argue on their terms.</strong> If the other person is fabricating facts, you are
                    unlikely to have a productive discussion. You may spend all your energy debating what is real
                    instead of making your point. The other person may use gaslighting techniques to declare they won an
                    argument. But you do not have to accept conclusions based on a faulty premise. <br>
                    <strong>Prioritize your safety.</strong> Gaslighting often makes targets doubt their own intuition.
                    But if you feel you are in danger, you can always leave the situation. You do not need to prove a
                    gaslighter‚Äôs threats of violence are sincere before calling the police. It is often safest to treat
                    every threat as credible. <br>
                    <strong>Remember you are not alone.</strong> You may find it helpful to talk about your experiences
                    with others. Friends and family can offer emotional support and validation. <br>
                    Therapy is a safe place where you can talk through your feelings and memories without judgment. A
                    therapist can help you recognize healthy and unhealthy behaviors. They can also teach you how to
                    resist psychological manipulation. In some cases, a therapist can help you develop a safety plan for
                    leaving the relationship.
